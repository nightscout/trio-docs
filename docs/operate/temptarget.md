# Temporary Targets

## Exercise

!!! tip "Tips"
    
    - Set a high temp target 1-2 hours before your exercise
    - Enable exercise-related settings in preferences to reduce insulin delivered while exercising
    - Pack a snack when you plan to exercise

Exercise can have immediate and long-term effects on glycemic control. Generally, individuals will find their blood sugar drops during intense exercise and continue to drop for 3-4 hours after. They may also experience increased insulin sensitivity for 24 hours after exercise.

Consuming enough slow-acting carbohydrates before and after your exercise session is important. Pack a snack in case you need a source of simple carbohydrates during your routine. 

Trio has some quality-of-life features that make exercise easier while looping. When you plan to exercise, increase your target approximately 2 hours before your exercise. If you have SMB enabled, be sure that ["Allow SMB With High Temptarget"](../settings/configuration/preferences/smbsettings.md#allow-smb-with-high-temptarget) is disabled. Finally, you can enable ["High Temptarget Raises Sensitivity"](../settings/configuration/preferences/targetsettings.md#high-temptarget-raises-sensitivity) to prevent Trio from providing too much insulin during exercise.

## Pre-Meal

!!! tip "Tips"
    
    - Set a low temp target 1-2 hours before meals to help with spikes
    - Enable "Low Temptarget Lowers Sensitivity" to allow for greater insulin delivery

If you plan to eat soon, you may want Trio to provide you extra room to fill up on carbs. One way you can do this is by setting a temp target approximately 1 mmol/L or 18 mg/dL below your target, 1-2 hours prior to meals. You can also enable ["Low Temptarget Lowers Sensitivity"](../settings/configuration/preferences/targetsettings.md#low-temptarget-lowers-sensitivity)  to give yourself more insulin for the upcoming meal and to bring your blood sugar down faster to the pre-meal range.
