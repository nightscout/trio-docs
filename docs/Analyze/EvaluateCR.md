    When in doubt, consult your diabetes care team for settings guidance.

### Before Adjusting CR

With Trio, there is a reduced requirement for precise carb entries, although some precision will still improve outcomes. Some users prefer overestimating carb entries and giving a smaller percentage of the upfront bolus. Note: If you overestimate the carb entry and bolus for 100% upfront, the algorithm is limited in its ability to only suspend insulin as a means to prevent hypoglycemia following a meal.

If you have been giving 100% of the needed bolus for meals, it might be best to try a smaller percentage upfront rather than adjusting your CR.

### Nightscout

Nightscout (NS) is a valuable resource that provides detailed information for analyzing your settings. Nightscout reports and Loopalyzer can be great tools for understanding your data.

Nightscout reports can provide crucial information to observe how fast the carbs decay. Open the day-to-day report in Nightscount and check the COB box and IOB box. You will see COB as orange “triangles.” If they decay too soon (in less than 2 hours or so, depending on the type and size of the meal), the carbs were either underestimated, CR could be too high a number, or ISF could be too low (carb decay is related to the fraction of CR/ISF) If you carbs take too long to decay, your insulin to carb ratio may be too strong. This can get complicated if meals overlap, but it is still possible. You may want to utilize the day-to-day report when that situation occurs.

If the carb absorption observed by the algorithm is too slow, COB will eventually be cut down. This presents as a vertical drop in COB in the day-to-day report. This helps avoid overdosing on overestimated or not-eaten carbs or if physical activity delays digestion or mutes the BG rise.
