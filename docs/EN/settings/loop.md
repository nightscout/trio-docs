# Closed Loop

Closed Loop is disabled by default. This means Trio cannot make adjustments autonomously. The system relies on your approval of its actions.

## Should I Enable It?
Closed Loop allows the system to make insulin adjustments automatically. Your end goal for looping is to enable this setting to reduce the time spent managing your diabetes. However, closing loop too early can make it difficult for new loopers wanting to optimize their ISF, CR, and basal settings. If this is your first time looping, it is recommended you keep this setting disabled initially, and ensure your profile settings (CR, ISF, basal rates) are properly set. You should monitor Trio's predictions and suggestions and see if they are appropriate for you. See the corresponding sections on CR, ISF, and basal rates for more information on their adjustment.

Remember that everyone's diabetes is different, and there is no one-size-fits-all, so take your time optimizing your settings.
