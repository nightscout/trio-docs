# Pump
This section allows you to select your insulin delivery system. For more information on supported pumps, see the following: [link](Getting-Started/pump.md). Older Omnipod and Medtronic devices require a Rileylink to translate communication between your phone's Bluetooth signals and the pump's radiocommunication.

During the setup, you will also be asked to choose your insulin type, which will determine your duration of insulin action and peak activity time.
