# Target Glucose

Trio will target this value when calculating insulin needs. It should be set to the blood glucose you would like to reach when corrections are made. A recommended value is between 90-110mg/dL or 5-6mmol/L

:::{tip}
You can set different targets at different times. Some users only have one target. Others have a lower target during the day and a higher target during the night to avoid lows.
