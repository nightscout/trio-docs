### Update every number of minutes
This setting determines how often the statistics are updated on the home screen and, for advanced users, controls how often statistics are uploaded to Nightscout.

### Display Loop Cycle statistics
This shows the average number of loops performed over the last 24 hours. Ideally, the number should be near 288, the maximum number of loops performed per day. Negative impacters include CPU speed, pump, and pod changes, connection issues, etc.

### Override HbA1c unit
By default, the estimated HbA1c statistic is given in percentage units. Enabling this toggle converts it to mmol/mol units.
