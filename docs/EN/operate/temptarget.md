# Temporary Targets

## Exercise

   - Set a high temp target 1-2 hours before your exercise
   - Enable exercise-related settings in preferences to reduce insulin delivered while exercising
   - Pack a snack when you plan to exercise

Exercise can have immediate and long-term effects on glycemic control. Generally, individuals will find their blood sugar drops during intense exercise and continue to drop for 3-4 hours after. They may also experience increased insulin sensitivity for 24 hours after exercise.

Consuming enough slow-acting carbohydrates before and after your exercise session is important. Pack a snack in case you need a source of simple carbohydrates during your routine. 

Trio has some quality-of-life features that make exercise easier while looping. When you plan to exercise, increase your target approximately 2 hours before your exercise. If you have SMB enabled, be sure that ["Allow SMB With High Temptarget"](../settings/configuration/preferences/smbsettings.md) is disabled. Finally, you can enable ["High Temptarget Raises Sensitivity"](../settings/configuration/preferences/targetsettings.md) to prevent Trio from providing too much insulin during exercise. 

## Pre-Meal

   - Set a low temp target 1-2 hours before meals to help with spikes
   - Enable "Low Temptarget Lowers Sensitivity" to allow for greater insulin delivery
:::

If you plan to eat soon, you may want Trio to provide you extra room to fill up on carbs. One way you can do this is by setting a temp target approximately 1 mmol/L or 18 mg/dL below your target, 1-2 hours prior to meals. You can also enable ["Low Temptarget Lowers Sensitivity"](../settings/configuration/preferences/targetsettings.md)  to give yourself more insulin for the upcoming meal and to bring your blood sugar down faster to the pre-meal range.
