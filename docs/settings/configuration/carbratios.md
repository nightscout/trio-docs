# Insulin Carbohydrate Ratio

!!! tip "Highlights"
    
	 - CR can be transferred from your pump
	 - Adjust your CR by performing a test meal experiment or observing autotune.

CR refers to the amount of carbohydrates one unit of insulin is able to neutralize. 

Example: Bill has a 1:10 CR (aka a CR of 10). If Bill has 20 carbs with lunch, he will need 2 U of rapid insulin to neutralize it.

CR is not changed as drastically as basal rates or ISF unless Dynamic CR is enabled. Your CR must be as accurate as possible for proper Trio function.

## Settings
It is safe to transfer your CR from your pump settings. However, your settings may not be accurate if you are experiencing high peaks with meals or lows three hours afterward. If you have SMB/UAM on and are experiencing sharp drops, you may also need to optimize your ISF.

There are two suggested methods of optimizing your CR. The standard way is a test meal experiment, which can be done while not looping. Have a meal with a known amount of carbohydrates and bolus according to your current CR. Monitor your blood sugar at the three-hour mark; did you go high, low, or end up where you started prior to the meal? If you end up high, you can make your CR more aggressive by _DECREASING_ the value. If you were low, make your CR less aggressive by _INCREASING_ the value. You may also look to increase or decrease your adjustment factor if you have dynamic CR on.

If you have autotune enabled, monitor the general trend in CR adjustment. When the autotune value stabilizes, evaluate the suggestion and change your scheduled value to the autotune value, allowing the system to continue making changes if it was being limited by a safety limiter.
