# Pump Settings

!!! tip  "Highlights"
    
	- Max Basal = 4x highest hourly basal
	- Max Bolus = Max bolus you give for a meal
	- Max Carbs = Maximum carbs allowed by a single entry
	- DIA = Duration of Insulin Action (typically 7 hours)

## Delivery Limits
These are safety limiters for Trio. Note that Trio will prevent you from entering anything higher than these limits, but it won't alert or notify you about it. 

### Max Basal
This is the highest temp basal allowed to be set. 4 times your highest scheduled basal rate is generally adequate. 

If Trio predicts you need a temp basal set higher than this value, it will instead set the basal to this maximum value. If you try to manually set a temp basal higher than this value, nothing will happen, and your current basal rate will not change. 

### Max Bolus
Choose the maximum amount of insulin you generally bolus for meals. This can also help if you regularly have leaking or tunneling issues for large boluses. 

If you enter a bolus higher than this value, it will only deliver this maximum value. So if your max bolus is set to 5U but you enter a 6U bolus, only 5U will be delivered. 

### Max Carbs
This is the maximum amount of carbs allowed in a single entry by Trio. If you enter more than this amount, your entry will be reduced to the maximum value. 

>If your Max Carbs setting is 125g and you enter 150g, only 125g will be recorded. You could then enter a second entry for 25g to make up the difference.

Note that, for now, this setting does not limit the maximum number of carbs that can be added via Nightscout or the watch app.

## Duration of Insulin Action

!!! warning
    
    It is not advised to decrease this setting

Duration of insulin action (DIA) affects Trio calculations through its impact on insulin on board (IOB). The default DIA of 5 hours is likely too low and can cause insulin stacking. Increasing to 7 hours should suit most users. For more information on DIA in loop systems, read [this](https://www.diabettech.com/insulin/why-we-are-regularly-wrong-in-the-duration-of-insulin-action-dia-times-we-use-and-why-it-matters/) from Tim Street.
