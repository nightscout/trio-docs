# Pump

This section allows you to select your insulin delivery system. For more information on supported pumps, see the following: [link](../../Getting-Started/pump.md). Older *Omnipod* and *Medtronic* devices require a *Rileylink* to translate communication between your phone's Bluetooth signals and the pump's radiocommunication.

During the setup, you will also be asked to choose your insulin type, which will determine your *duration of insulin action* (DIA) and peak activity time.
