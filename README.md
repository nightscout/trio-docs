Repository for [Trio documentation (under development)](https://docs.diy-trio.org)

## Install

- [**Clone**](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this project
- Install **Python  3**
  For help getting *Python* installed, see "[Properly Installing Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)".
- Install a **Python Virtual Environment**.  
  In this example, I use [`venv`](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/#how-can-you-work-with-a-python-virtual-environment), but use whichever you prefer.  
  ```shell
  cd trio-docs # where you cloned the trio-docs repository
  
  # Creates a virtual environment using Python 3 in the venv folder
  python3 -m venv venv 

  # Activate the virtual environment
  # IMPORTANT: Run the next line **each time** you start a new shell window/tab
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- **Install** the **dependencies** (that is the project's required *Python* packages)
  ```shell
  cd trio-docs # where you cloned the trio-docs repository

  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Run


### Preview Changes

Once [installed](#install), you can preview the doc locally as you make changes:

- Run the **`mkdocs serve`** command locally in a separate terminal window and keep it running:
  ```shell
  cd trio-docs # where you cloned the trio-docs repository
  source bin/venv/activate # Do this once when opening a shell or if the shell prompt no longer displays `(venv)`
  
  mkdocs serve
  ```
    By default, this runs a local web server that hosts the documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ .
* Preview the site in your Web browser.  
  Most changes will update automatically as you edit.  
  Configuration and navigation changes will require restarting `mkdocs serve`.

### Build the Website Locally

```shell
cd trio-docs # where you cloned the trio-docs repository
source venv/bin/activate # Do this once when opening a shell or if the shell prompt no longer displays `(venv)`

mkdocs build
```

This does not generate the website's PDF version.

### Build the PDF

To export the website as a PDF:

```shell
cd trio-docs # where you cloned the trio-docs repository
source venv/bin/activate # Do this once when opening a shell or if the shell prompt no longer displays `(venv)`

MKDOCS_EXPORTER_PDF=true  mkdocs build
```

 The PDF file is generated in`site/trio-docs.pdf`.
 
## Contribute

You can contribute to the Trio documentation by correcting typos or suggesting new content.

### Using  the  Terminal

```
cd trio-docs # where you cloned the trio-docs repository

# Activate the Python virtual environment 
#  (if the shell prompt does not display `(venv)`)
source venv/bin/activate

# Declare the official remote trio-docs GitHub repository 
# The remote repository name convention is:
# - origin denotes your copy of the `trio-docs` repository on GitHub
# - upstream denotes the official `trio-docs` repository on GitHub
# You already created `origin` before.
# `upstream` does not exist yet, we now need to create it.
#
# These are shortcuts for the remote repositories 
#   short name => long name (URL)
# We use the short name not to memorize and type the long name (see line below) each time we need to interact with it.
#
git remote add upstream https://github.com/nightscout/trio-docs.git

# Fetch the changes from the remote repositories
git fetch origin
git fetch upstream

# Jump on the `dev` branch
# `dev` contains the source code for the site ready to be deployed)
git switch dev

# Bring recent changes for the `dev` branch back from the official trio-docs repository (`upstream`)
git merge upstream/dev

# Example: We want to add a FAQ page in the `docs/resources/` folder

# Create (`-c`) and jump on a new feature branch where to add the FAQ page
#
git switch -c add_FAQ_page

# Create then edit the new FAQ file (`faq.md`)
MY_FAVORITE_EDITOR_HERE docs/resources/faq.md

# Edit, preview, repeat...
# until you are satisfied with the changes.

# ➡️ 🏬: Add the FAQ page to the warehouse
git add docs/resources/faq.md

# 🏬 ➡️ 🚚: Move all the changes from the warehouse into your **local** repository 
git commit -am "Add FAQ page"

# 🚚 ➡️ ⛅️: Push your feature branch `doc/add_FAQ_page` to your remote repository
git push -u origin add_FAQ_page
```

- Now open the **official trio-docs repository** in your **Web browser** 
   https://github.com/nightscout/trio-docs/pulls
- Click the **pull-requests tab**  
  This page displays a box saying you can create a Pull-Request for your branch.
- Click the button to do so, then follow the instructions.

## Add a Plugin

- Create a feature branch
- Add the pinned version of the new plugin to the **`requirements.in`** file
  ```shell
    MY_FAVORITE_EDITOR_HERE requirements.in
    
    # Add the pinned version (i.e. plugin name + version) to `requirements.in
    XXX_PLUGIN_NAME_HERE==XXX_PLUGIN_VERSION_HERE
    ```
    For example, add this line `mkdocs-exporter==6.1.1` to `requirements.in`
- Generate **`requirements.txt`**
  ```shell
    cd trio-docs
    
    # IMPORTANT: The project's virtual environment MUST be activated first
    source venv/bin/activate
    
    # Remove already installed plugins
    python -m pip freeze --exclude-editable | xargs python -m pip uninstall -y
    
    # Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.in`
    # This installs the indirect dependencies these plugins depend upon.
    pip install -r requirements.in
    
    # Generate `requirements.txt` with both direct AND indirect dependencies
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    
    # Commit the changes (where XXX denotes the plugin name)
    git add requirements.in requirements.txt
    git commit -m "➕ Add dependency XXX"
    ```
  
## Tips & Tricks

> [!NOTE] 
> Please add!

### Add a Chapter

Using the `#` sign shows a chapter on the menu/index. The amount of `#`'s determines the level. 

**Example**:

```markdown
# README

## Tips & Tricks

### Add a Chapter

### Link to Another File
```

> [!TIP] 
> If you want to avoid a chapter ending up in the menu/index, use bold text by:
> - either surrounding the text with 2-star signs `**` 
> - or adding `<b>` before the text and `</b>` after the text (without spaces).  
> 
> Input              | Result        
> ------------------ | ------------- 
> `**bold text**`    | **bold text** 
>  `<b>bold text</b>` | **bold text** 

### Link to Another File

When linking to another Markdown file (ending with `.md`) in another directory, the link must start with `../`.

**Example**: `../directoryname/filename.md`
