Repository for [Trio documentation (under development)](https://docs.diy-trio.org)

## Install

- [**Clone**](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this project
- Install **Python  3**
  For help getting *Python* installed, see "[Properly Installing Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)".
- Install a **Python Virtual Environment**.  
  In this example, I use [`venv`](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/#how-can-you-work-with-a-python-virtual-environment), but use whichever you prefer.  
  ```shell
  cd trio-docs # where you cloned the trio-docs repository
  
  # Creates a virtual environment using Python 3 in the venv folder
  python3 -m venv venv 

  # Activate the virtual environment
  # IMPORTANT: Run the next line **each time** you start a new shell window/tab
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- **Install** the **dependencies** (that is the project's required *Python* packages)
  ```shell
  cd trio-docs # where you cloned the trio-docs repository

  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Run


### Preview Changes

Once [installed](#install), you can preview the doc locally as you make changes:

- Run the **`mkdocs serve`** command locally in a separate terminal window and keep it running:
  ```shell
  cd trio-docs # where you cloned the trio-docs repository
  source bin/venv/activate # Do this once when opening a shell or if the shell prompt no longer displays `(venv)`
  
  mkdocs serve
  ```
    By default, this runs a local web server that hosts the documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ .
* Preview the site in your Web browser.  
  Most changes will update automatically as you edit.  
  Configuration and navigation changes will require restarting `mkdocs serve`.

### Build the Website Locally

```shell
cd trio-docs # where you cloned the trio-docs repository
source venv/bin/activate # Do this once when opening a shell or if the shell prompt no longer displays `(venv)`

mkdocs build
```

This does not generate the website's PDF version.

### Build the PDF

To export the website as a PDF:

```shell
cd trio-docs # where you cloned the trio-docs repository
source venv/bin/activate # Do this once when opening a shell or if the shell prompt no longer displays `(venv)`

MKDOCS_EXPORTER_PDF=true  mkdocs build
```

 The PDF file is generated in`site/trio-docs.pdf`.
 
## Contribute

You can contribute to the Trio documentation by correcting typos or suggesting new content.

### Using  the  Terminal

```
cd trio-docs # where you cloned the trio-docs repository

# Activate the Python virtual environment 
#  (if the shell prompt does not display `(venv)`)
source venv/bin/activate

# Declare the official remote trio-docs GitHub repository 
# The remote repository name convention is:
# - origin denotes your copy of the `trio-docs` repository on GitHub
# - upstream denotes the official `trio-docs` repository on GitHub
# You already created `origin` before.
# `upstream` does not exist yet, we now need to create it.
#
# These are shortcuts for the remote repositories 
#   short name => long name (URL)
# We use the short name not to memorize and type the long name (see line below) each time we need to interact with it.
#
git remote add upstream https://github.com/nightscout/trio-docs.git

# Fetch the changes from the remote repositories
git fetch origin
git fetch upstream

# Jump on the `dev` branch
# `dev` contains the source code for the site ready to be deployed)
git switch dev

# Bring recent changes for the `dev` branch back from the official trio-docs repository (`upstream`)
git merge upstream/dev

# Example: We want to add a FAQ page in the `docs/resources/` folder

# Create (`-c`) and jump on a new feature branch where to add the FAQ page
#
git switch -c add_FAQ_page

# Create then edit the new FAQ file (`faq.md`)
MY_FAVORITE_EDITOR_HERE docs/resources/faq.md

# Edit, preview, repeat...
# until you are satisfied with the changes.

# ➡️ 🏬: Add the FAQ page to the warehouse
git add docs/resources/faq.md

# 🏬 ➡️ 🚚: Move all the changes from the warehouse into your **local** repository 
git commit -am "Add FAQ page"

# 🚚 ➡️ ⛅️: Push your feature branch `doc/add_FAQ_page` to your remote repository
git push -u origin add_FAQ_page
```

- Now open the **official trio-docs repository** in your **Web browser** 
   https://github.com/nightscout/trio-docs/pulls
- Click the **pull-requests tab**  
  This page displays a box saying you can create a Pull-Request for your branch.
- Click the button to do so, then follow the instructions.

### Add a Plugin

- Create a feature branch
- Add the pinned version of the new plugin to the **`requirements.in`** file
  ```shell
    MY_FAVORITE_EDITOR_HERE requirements.in
    
    # Add the pinned version (i.e. plugin name + version) to `requirements.in
    XXX_PLUGIN_NAME_HERE==XXX_PLUGIN_VERSION_HERE
    ```
    For example, add this line `mkdocs-exporter==6.1.1` to `requirements.in`
- Generate **`requirements.txt`**
  ```shell
    cd trio-docs
    
    # IMPORTANT: The project's virtual environment MUST be activated first
    source venv/bin/activate
    
    # Remove already installed plugins
    python -m pip freeze --exclude-editable | xargs python -m pip uninstall -y
    
    # Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.in`
    # This installs the indirect dependencies these plugins depend upon.
    pip install -r requirements.in
    
    # Generate `requirements.txt` with both direct AND indirect dependencies
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    
    # Commit the changes (where XXX denotes the plugin name)
    git add requirements.in requirements.txt
    git commit -m "➕ Add dependency XXX"
    ```
  
## Tips & Tricks

> [!NOTE] 
> Please add!

### Add a Chapter

Using the `#` sign shows a chapter on the menu/index. The amount of `#`'s determines the level. 

**Example**:

```markdown
# README

## Tips & Tricks

### Add a Chapter

### Link to Another File
```

> [!TIP] 
> If you want to avoid a chapter ending up in the menu/index, use bold text by:
> - either surrounding the text with 2-star signs `**` 
> - or adding `<b>` before the text and `</b>` after the text (without spaces).  
> 
> Input              | Result        
> ------------------ | ------------- 
> `**bold text**`    | **bold text** 
>  `<b>bold text</b>` | **bold text** 

### Link to Another File

When linking to another Markdown file (ending with `.md`) in another directory, the link must start with `../`.

**Example**: `../directoryname/filename.md`

### Migrate a Sphinx page to Mkdocs

#### Migrate an Admonition from Sphinx to Mkdocs

> [!NOTE] 
> **What is an admonition?**  
> An **admonition** is a rectangular box with a **title** (optional) and a text **body**.  
> Each admonition type has a **specific icon** and box **border color**.
> 
> For instance, a *warning* admonition has a yellow icon and border. Its icon is an exclamation sign in a yellow triangle.

This is what an admonition looks like in **Sphinx**:

```markdown
:::{warning}
This is not medical advice.  
Understanding the changes you are making is important, and always be sure to exercise caution.  
When in doubt, consult your diabetes care team for settings guidance.
:::
```

Here is what the same admonition looks like in "**Mkdocs**-material":

```markdown
!!! warning
    
    This is not medical advice.
    Understanding the changes you are making is important, and always be sure to exercise caution.
    When in doubt, consult your diabetes care team for settings guidance.
```

where:
- The **title** line contains (in this order):
  - 3 exclamation characters `!!!`
  - a space ` `
  - the [admonition **type**](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/#supported-types),  (`warning` in the above example)
  - a space
  - an optional **title** (none in this example) surrounded by double quotes.
    We could have used `"Not a Medical Advice"` to set a title.
- Each line of the **body text** (lines below the title)  
  **must** be **indented 4-spaces**.
  I use the `␠` character to denote a space (` `) in the example below. to make it stand out. Do not copy and paste this, it is only for visual purposes.
  ```markdown
    !!! warning "Not medical advice"
    ␠␠␠␠
    ␠␠␠␠ Understanding the changes you are making is important [...]
    ```

> [!TIP] 
> **Separate the Title and Body with an Empty Line**  
> 
> - Adding a blank line (4 spaces indented) between the title and the body of the text makes a visual distinction for the reader.
>   This is not required. 
> - When present in the body text, empty lines must also use a 4-space indentation.

> [!NOTE] 
> Mkdocs (the site generation engine) does not provide admonitions but [mkdocs-material (the theme) does](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions) via the `pymdownx` Markdown extension.
